<manpage manpage(5) "Man Page Documentation Syntax">

<section SYNOPSIS>

<itemlist>

<section DESCRIPTION>

This is the format used to produce man pages for Quill's internal
libraries; it is also available to other Quill projects.  manpage(5)
is an HTML like format in which the tags are actually 
<i macros>: Tcl commands which return text.  The tags are replaced
by the returned text.<p>

manpage(5) defines a number of macros suitable for formatting the
content of man pages.  Individual man pages can define additional
macros as needed.<p>

The <xref manpage(n)> processor translates manpage(5) files into
HTML; in principle, however, additional back-ends could be defined to
translate the format into other kinds of output.<p>

This section explains how to prepare man page files for use with
<xref manpage(n)>.

<subsection "Manual Sections">

Following Unix conventions, it is pretended that the manual pages
written using manpage(5) fall into one of the standard Unix manual
sections.  At present, manpage(5) supports sections:<p>

<topiclist>
<topic "Section 1: Applications">
I.e., commands that can be entered at the command-line.<p>

<topic "Section 5: File formats">
E.g., this man page.<p>

<topic "Section n: Tcl commands">
For some reason Tcl documents its commands in section "n", and 
so we will follow suit.<p>

<topic "Section i: Tcl interfaces">
This is a new section, used to define standard Tcl interfaces that 
are shared by many different objects.<p>
</topiclist>

Most man pages written with manpage(5) will fit into one of these
sections; however, <xref manpage(n)> allows the client to define 
additional sections as needed.<p>

Also by convention, man pages have a short name, usually followed by
section number in parentheses.  Thus, "manpage(5)" is the
"manpage" man page in section 5; it is the page that documents the
"manpage" file format.  <xref manpage(n)>, on the other hand,
documents the "manpage" module that produces formatted HTML output
from manpage(5) input.<p>

<subsection "Directory Layout">

<xref manpage(n)> can create links to the other man pages defined in
the same project, provided that the following directory tree is used
for all man pages:<p>

<ul>
  <li> <tt><i docRoot>/man1/</tt>
  <li> <tt><i docRoot>/man5/</tt>
  <li> <tt><i docRoot>/mann/</tt>
</ul><p>

That is, there are sibling subdirectories for each section called
<tt man1>, <tt man5>, <tt mann>, and <tt mani> respectively.<p>

<subsection "Man Page Names and Files">

Further, <xref manpage(n)> assumes that each man page file has the
same bare file name as its man page name.  For example, this man page
is manpage(5).  The source for this page is
<tt docs/man5/manpage.manpage>, and the formatted page is
<tt docs/man5/manpage.html>.<p>

<subsection "Man Page Sections">

Each man page is divided into sections, and possibly into
subsections, using the <xref #section> and <xref #subsection>
macros.  The standard sections are as follows:<p>

<topiclist sections>
<topic "SYNOPSIS">
A brief statement of the calling sequence of the application
(section 1) or library (section n), possibly followed by a list
of <xref "#Man Page Items"> defined in the man page.<p>

<topic "DESCRIPTION">
An overview of the documented command, format, or library,
possibly with subsections describing its background or use.<p>

<topic "COMMANDS">
For section n, Tcl commands defined by the man page.<p>

<topic "BUGS">
Any known bugs.<p>

<topic "HISTORY">
The module's history.<p>

<topic "AUTHOR">
The man page/module's author.<p>

<topic "SEE ALSO">
Links to related man pages and other documents.<p>
</topiclist sections>

Other sections may be defined as needed.<p>

<subsection "Man Page Items">

A single man page will often document a series of "items".  A section
n man page will document the Tcl commands in a library, for example,
and this man page documents a collection of <xref #MACROS> used to
write man pages.  Items are documented in definition lists using
the <xref #deflist> macro; each item in a definition list is defined
using the <xref #defitem> macro.  Each <xref #defitem> macro is
followed by prose documenting the item.  Each definition list is
concluded by a <xref #/deflist> macro.<p>

<subsection "Cross-References">

The <xref #xref> macro creates cross-reference links to sections within
the same manpage or to other manpages or, in fact, to arbitrary web
pages.  Cross-reference links may be specified in a number of ways.

<topiclist xrefs>
<topic "<tt>#<i section></tt>">
<topic "<tt>#<i item></tt>">
References a section or subsection, given its title, or an
item, given its name, within the current man page.  E.g.,
"<tt #DESCRIPTION>" or "<tt #xref>".<p>

<topic "<tt><i name>(<i sec>)</tt>">
References the named man page, e.g., "<tt manpage(5)>"<p>

<topic "<tt><i name>(<i sec>)#<i section></tt>">
<topic "<tt><i name>(<i sec>)#<i item></tt>">
References a section by its title or an item by its name within
the named man page.   E.g.,
"<tt manpage(5)#DESCRIPTION>" or "<tt manpage(5)#xref>".<p>

<topic "<tt><i url></tt>">
References a web page by its URL.  At present, only "http" URLs
are supported.  E.g., "<tt http://my.sample.url>"<p>

</topiclist xrefs>

<subsection "Man Page Skeleton">

A man page file defines a single man page.<p>

Each man page file begins with a <xref #manpage> macro which names and
titles the man page.  This is followed by one or sections and
subsections, each introduced by the <xref #section> or
<xref #subsection> macro.  The "SYNOPSIS" section will frequently
contain an <xref #itemlist> macro, which expands to a list of links
to each of the items defined in the body of the web page.<p>

Other sections may contain definition lists, which
define one or more items (i.e, commands, macros, etc.).  Each
definition list begins with a <xref #deflist> macro and ends with a
<xref #/deflist> macro; individual items begin with
the <xref #defitem> macro, followed by prose which documents the
item.<p>

Prose may contain cross-references, defined using the
<xref #xref> macro.<p>

Each man page file ends with the <xref #/manpage> macro.<p>

<section MACROS>

The following macros may be used in man pages.<p>

<subsection "Structural Macros">

These macros are used to define the structure of the man page.
They are presented in the order in which they are ordinarily used.

<deflist structural>

<defitem manpage {manpage <i>name title</i> ?<i>parent</i>?}>

This macro should be the first to appear in every man page file.
The <i>name</i> is the man page's name.
The <i>title</i> is a short description of the documented module.
For example,<p>

<pre>
<lb>manpage manpage(1) "manpage(5) formatting tool"<rb>
</pre>

If the documented module is part of a larger package, then
<i parent> should be the name of that package's overall man page.<p>

<defitem section {section <i>title</i>}>

Defines a major section within the man page; the section title will be
added to the table of contents, and can be used as an
<xref #xref> reference.  By convention, section titles are in
ALL CAPS.  For example,<p>

<pre>
<lb>section DESCRIPTION<rb>
   .
   .
   .
<lb>section "SEE ALSO"<rb>
</pre>

<defitem subsection {subsection <i>title</i>}>

Defines a subsection of a major section.  The subsection title will be
added to the table of contents, and can be used as an
<xref #xref> reference.  By convention, subsection titles are in
Mixed Case.  For example,<p>

<pre>
<lb>section DESCRIPTION<rb>
   .
   .
   .
<lb>subsection "The Specifics"<rb>
</pre>

<defitem /manpage {/manpage}>

This macro ends the man page, and should be the final macro in the 
file.<p>

</deflist structural>

<subsection "Definition List Macros">

Definition lists are the primary means of documenting items of code:
Tcl commands and subcommands, macros, and anything else that should be
listed in the "SYNOPSIS" section.<p>

The following macros are used to define definition lists.

<deflist definition lists>

<defitem deflist {deflist <i>args...</i>}>

Begins a definition list.  The <i>args</i> are ignored.  By
convention, each <xref #deflist> macro includes arguments which
indicate the kind of thing being listed; the <xref #/deflist> macro
repeats them.  This avoids confusion when definition lists are nested.
For example,<p>

<pre>
<lb>section COMMANDS<rb>

This module defines the following commands:<lb>p<rb>

<lb>deflist commands<rb>
    .
    .
    .
<lb>/deflist commands<rb>
</pre>

Items are defined within a definition list using <xref #defitem>.<p>

<defitem defitem {defitem <i>name text</i>}>

Begins the documentation of an item in a definition list.  The
<i>name</i> is the item's name, by which it will be linked.  In a list
of commands, for example, <i>name</i> is the command name.  The
<i>text</i> is the complete representation of the item.  For a
command, <i>text</i> would be the signature of the command.  For example,<p>

<pre>
<lb>defitem section {section <lb>i<rb>title<lb>/i<rb>}<rb>
</pre>

Tcl conventions are followed for command signatures.  Literal text is
in normal type, dummy arguments are in <i>italics</i>, optional
arguments are bracketed by question marks, and arguments which can be
repeated include "...".  In this example,<p>

<pre>
<lb>defitem xref {xref <lb>i<rb>ref<lb>/i<rb> ?<lb>i<rb>text<lb>/i<rb>?}<rb>
</pre>

"xref" is the literal macro name, "<lb>i<rb>ref<lb>/i<rb>" is a dummy argument,
and "?<lb>i<rb>text<lb>/i<rb>?" is an optional argument.<p>

<defitem defopt {defopt <i>option text</i>}>

Begins the documentation of an option in a definition list of options.
For example,<p>

<pre>
<lb>defopt -myoption {-myoption <i>value</i>}<rb>
</pre>

At present options are not listed in the <xref #itemlist>, but that may
change in the future.<p>

<defitem /deflist {/deflist <i>args...</i>}>

Ends a definition list.  As with <xref #deflist>, the <i>args</i>
are ignored.<p>

<defitem itemlist {itemlist}>

This macro returns a list of links to the items defined in the page.
It's usually placed in the "SYNOPSIS" section.<p>

</deflist definition lists>

<subsection "Topic List Macros">

Topic lists are similar to 
<xref "#Definition List Macros" "definition lists"> 
but do not define items for inclusion in the "SYNOPSIS" 
section.<p>

<deflist topic lists>

<defitem topiclist {topiclist <i>args...</i>}>

Begins a topic list.  As with definition lists, the <i>args</i> 
are ignored.  By convention, each <xref #topiclist> macro 
includes arguments which indicate the kind of thing being listed; 
the <xref #/topiclist> macro repeats them.  This avoids confusion when
topic lists are nested. For example,<p>

<pre>
<lb>topiclist man page section types<rb>
    .
    .
    .
<lb>/topiclist man page section types<rb>
</pre>

Topics are defined within a topic list using <xref #topic>.<p>

<defitem topic {topic <i>text</i>}>

Begins the documentation of a topic in a topic list.  The
<i>text</i> is the complete representation of the topic; it may
include nested macros.<p>

<defitem /topiclist {/topiclist <i>args...</i>}>

Ends a topic list.  As with <xref #topiclist>, the <i>args</i>
are ignored.<p>

</deflist topic lists>

<subsection "Cross-Reference Macros">

<deflist cross-references>

<defitem xref {xref <i>ref</i> ?<i>text</i>?}>

Creates a cross-reference link to the page/anchor identified by
<i>ref</i>; see <xref #Cross-References> for the many kinds of
reference understood by <xref #xref>.<p>

If <i>text</i> is given, it is used as the link text.  Otherwise,
if <i>ref</i> explicitly names an anchor, i.e., a section title or
item name, the anchor is used; otherwise, the page name is used.<p>

This reference links to the named man page, and uses the man page name
as the link text:<p>

<pre>
<lb>xref manpage(1)<rb>
</pre>

This reference links to the "COMMANDS" section and uses the section
title as the link text:<p>

<pre>
<lb>xref #COMMANDS<rb>
</pre>

This reference links to the "xref" item in "manpage(5)", and uses the
item name as the link text:<p>

<pre>
<lb>xref manpage(5)#xref<rb>
</pre>

This reference links to the "xref" item, but uses "cross-reference"
as the link text:<p>

<pre>
<lb>xref #xref "cross-reference"<rb>
</pre>

</deflist cross-references>

<subsection "HTML Equivalent Macros">

manpage(5) format was designed to translate easily to HTML, but also to
support other back-end translations.  Thus, it defines a number of macros that have direct HTML equivalents.<p>

<deflist html macros>

<defitem li {<lb>li<rb>...<lb>/li<rb>}>
<defitem ol {<lb>ol<rb>...<lb>/ol<rb>}>
<defitem p  {<lb>p<rb>...<lb>/p<rb>}>
<defitem ul {<lb>ul<rb>...<lb>/ul<rb>}>

These macros map directly to their HTML namesakes.<p>

<defitem b {<lb>b<rb>...<lb>/b<rb> or <lb>b <i text>...<rb>}>
<defitem code {<lb>code<rb>...<lb>/code<rb> or <lb>code <i text>...<rb>}>
<defitem em {<lb>em<rb>...<lb>/em<rb> or <lb>em <i text>...<rb>}>
<defitem i {<lb>i<rb>...<lb>/i<rb> or <lb>i <i text>...<rb>}>
<defitem pre {<lb>pre<rb>...<lb>/pre<rb> or <lb>pre <i text>...<rb>}>
<defitem strong {<lb>strong<rb>...<lb>/strong<rb> or <lb>strong <i text>...<rb>}>
<defitem tt {<lb>tt<rb>...<lb>/tt<rb> or <lb>tt <i text>...<rb>}>

These style tags have two forms, an HTML-like form and a convenience
form.  For example,<p>

<pre><lb>i this is italics<rb></pre>

is identical to<p>

<pre><lb>i<rb>this is italics<lb>/i<rb></pre>

Note that when convenience form is used, the <i text...> may not contain nested macros.  For example, the following will not yield bold italic
text:<p>

<pre><lb>b <lb>i this is not bold italics<rb><rb></pre>

</deflist html macros>

<subsection "Other Macros">

<deflist other macros>

<defitem do {do <i>script</i>}>

The <i>script</i> is evaluated in the global context, and any return
value is thrown away.  Use this to load required packages and define
module-specific macros.<p>

<defitem lb {lb}>

Returns the left macro expansion bracket, "<lb>".<p>

<defitem link {link <i url> ?<i text>?}>

Returns a link to the given <i url>.  If <i text> is given, 
it is used as the link text; otherwise, the <i url> is displayed.<p>

<defitem rb {rb}>

Returns the right macro expansion bracket, "<rb>".<p>

<defitem version {version}>

Returns the version number string given to the 
<xref manpage(n)> object's <xref manpage(n)#format> subcommand.<p>

</deflist other macros>

<section BUGS>

<ul>
  <li> Section titles and item names are in the same namespace, and so
       can conflict.  As item names are usually lower case and titles
       are usually mixed case with initial caps, this isn't generally
       a problem.<p>

  <li> <xref #defopt> options are not included in the itemlist.<p>

  <li> <xref #defopt> options cannot be linked to!<p>
</ul>

<section HISTORY>

This is a new format and macro set, based loosely on many similar efforts
I've written in the past in other contexts.<p>
