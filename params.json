{"name":"Quill","tagline":"Build tool for Tcl/Tk projects","body":"# Quill\r\n\r\nQuill is a build tool for Tcl/Tk projects, inspired by\r\n[Leiningen](http://leiningen.org).  It is intended to:\r\n\r\n* Create new skeleton project trees.\r\n* Run test suites\r\n* Format HTML documentation\r\n* Manage dependencies\r\n  * External and internal\r\n* Execute your project\r\n* Execute arbitrary scripts in the context of your project's code base\r\n* Build deployment targets:\r\n  * Standalone executables (\"starpacks\")\r\n  * Lightweight executables (\"starkits\")\r\n  * Reusable packages (teapot .zip modules)\r\n* Make it easy to build and deploy Tcl applications and libraries.\r\n* Run cross-platform (Windows, OS X, Linux)\r\n\r\nAs such, it is intended to reduce the ancillary costs of defining and\r\ndeploying a Tcl package or executable to as close to zero as possible, by\r\nautomating everything but the actual writing of the code and documentation. \r\n\r\n## Building and Installation\r\n\r\nTo install Quill, see [docs/INSTALL.md](./docs/INSTALL.md).\r\n\r\nTo build Quill from scratch, see [docs/BUILD.md](./docs/BUILD.md).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Basic Use Case\r\n\r\nAssuming you have ActiveTcl 8.5 or later installed, with the installation's\r\n`tclsh` on your path, you should be able to do the following:\r\n\r\n**Download and install `quill.exe` in your ~/bin directory (or wherever).**\r\nSee [docs/INSTALL.md](./docs/INSTALL.md).\r\n\r\n**Create a new skeleton project tree:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd ~/work\r\n$ quill new app my-application myapp\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Run your new application:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd my-application\r\n$ ./bin/myapp.tcl a b c\r\nmy-application 0.0a0\r\n\r\nArgs: <a b c>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Run the application test suite:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ quill test\r\n... Runs dummy test (which will fail)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Build the project's HTML documentation:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ quill docs\r\n... (You'll have to write some)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Build the Application (if TDK is installed) as a .kit or standalone\r\nexecutable:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ quill build\r\n...\r\n$ ./bin/myapp.kit a b c\r\nmy-application 0.0a0\r\n\r\nArgs: <a b c>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Load the application and its libraries into Tkcon for interactive\r\ntesting:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ quill shell\r\n... (Invokes Tkcon; does not run the application's \"main\" proc)\r\n```\r\n\r\n** Install your application and libraries for local use:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ quill install\r\n... (Copies the executable to your ~/bin, and libraries to your teapot)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Other Features\r\n\r\nQuill can also build library packages and install them into your local\r\nteapot repository for general use; and if your local teapot is located\r\nsomewhere that requires \"root\" or \"admin\" privileges to touch, it can\r\nalso create a new teapot repository for you in your home page.\r\n\r\nThen, you can add `require` statements to your `project.quill` file\r\n(created for you by `quill new`), and Quill will take care of downloading\r\nthe required packages into your local teapot when you execute \r\n`quill deps update`.\r\n\r\nFinally, if you define a distribution in `project.quill`, Quill will build\r\ndistribution .zip file for you.\r\n\r\nSee the [quill(5)](./docs/man5/quill.manpage) man page for information about\r\nthe contents of the `project.quill` file, and enter `quill help` at the\r\ncommand line for help on Quill and its subcommands.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nHow much Quill can do for you depends on what ancillary tools you have \r\ninstalled.  You will need a Tcl interpreter at the very least.\r\n\r\nWith just an arbitrary Tcl interpreter, Quill can:\r\n\r\n* Create new project trees for you.\r\n* Run your tests\r\n* Format your documentation\r\n* Make it easier to run your code, either from the system command line or \r\n  from an interactive Tcl shell.\r\n* Create distribution .zip files.\r\n\r\nWith [ActiveTcl](http://www.activestate.com/activetcl), Quill can:\r\n\r\n* Manage external dependencies, pulling packages from ActiveState's\r\n  teapot repository and keeping them up to date in your environment.\r\n\r\nWith [TclDevKit 5.0](http://www.activestate.com/tcl-dev-kit), Quill can:\r\n\r\n* Build standalone executables for Linux, OS X, and Windows\r\n* Build libraries as teapot packages, for installation into a local\r\n  teapot repository. \r\n\r\n## Ways to Help\r\n\r\nI'm developing Quill on OS X, but I'm trying to write it so that will work \r\non OS X, Linux, and Windows, and on Unix in general.  For Windows I'm \r\nexpecting that Quill is being used from a MinGW bash shell rather than \r\nPowerShell or the basic Command Shell, but I'm trying not to rely on that.\r\n\r\nHowever, I only have access to OS X.  Thus, it would be \r\na great help to me to have users try it out on other platforms and submit\r\nbug reports and patches.\r\n\r\nNote that platform-specific code is concentrated in `lib/quillapp/plat.tcl`.\r\nThat's where Quill finds external programs like `tkcon` and `teacup`, for\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I've focussed on using ActiveState's \"teapot\" package \r\nrepository and TclDevKit tool chain, because I have access to those.\r\nI'm open to extending Quill to use other tool chains as well; and help\r\nwith that is also welcome.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThanks to the following people who have contributed bug reports, patches,\r\nor ideas to Quill, or helped in other ways:\r\n\r\n* Stephan Effelsberg\r\n* Andreas Kupries\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
